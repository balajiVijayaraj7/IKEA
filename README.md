# IKEA Store Expansion Analysis using K-Means Clustering

## Introduction
Welcome to the IKEA Store Expansion Analysis repository. This project focuses on using the k-means clustering method to identify potential locations in Sweden for new IKEA department stores. By analyzing essential features of Sweden's municipalities, this analysis aims to provide actionable insights and recommendations for IKEA's expansion strategy.

## Data Exploration
The project utilizes the `ikea_kommun_data.txt` file, containing crucial features of Sweden's municipalities. The goal is to identify relevant features for IKEA store expansion.

## Data Transformation
Data from the `ikea_kommun_data.txt` file is transformed into a suitable format for clustering analysis. The key step is to prepare the data for the subsequent k-means clustering algorithm.

## Data Reduction
To improve the performance of the clustering algorithm, dimensionality reduction techniques may be applied. This step reduces the complexity of the data while preserving its essential characteristics.

## K-Means Clustering
The k-means clustering method is applied to the transformed and reduced data. This step groups municipalities with similar features together, identifying potential areas for new IKEA stores.

## Cluster Evaluation
The obtained clusters are evaluated to determine the most promising municipalities for IKEA expansion. These municipalities could be considered for further analysis and investment.

## Visualization
The results are visualized to gain a better understanding of the clusters and the distribution of data across different municipalities.

## Recommendations
Based on the findings from the k-means clustering analysis, actionable insights and recommendations for IKEA's expansion strategy are provided.

## Conclusion

The IKEA Store Expansion Analysis repository offers an effective approach to identify potential locations for new IKEA department stores using k-means clustering. By exploring and analyzing Sweden's municipality data, this project provides valuable insights for IKEA's expansion strategy, aiding in making informed decisions for future store locations.
